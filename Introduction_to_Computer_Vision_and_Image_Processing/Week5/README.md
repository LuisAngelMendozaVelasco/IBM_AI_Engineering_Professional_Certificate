# Object Detection

In this module, you will learn about object detection with different methods. The first approach is using the Haar Cascade classifier, the second one is to use R-CNN and MobileNet.

# Learning Objectives

- Evaluate the classification Performance of Haar Cascade Classifiers
- Evaluate the classification performance of these CNN models
- Compare the results different models
