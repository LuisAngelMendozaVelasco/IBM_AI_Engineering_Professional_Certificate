# Neural Networks and Deep Learning for Image Classification

In this module, you will learn about Neural Networks, fully connected Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). You will learn about different components such as Layers and different types of activation functions such as ReLU. You also get to know the different CNN Architecture such as ResNet and LenNet.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the main components of Neural Networks.
- Execute an implementation of an image classification using tools such as PyTorch.
- Define Transfer Learning and Different CNN Architectures.
