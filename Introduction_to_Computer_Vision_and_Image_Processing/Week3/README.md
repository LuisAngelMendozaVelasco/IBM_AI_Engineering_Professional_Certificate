# Machine Learning Image Classification

In this module, you will Learn About the different Machine learning classification Methods commonly used for Computer vision, including k nearest neighbours, Logistic regression, SoftMax Regression and Support Vector Machines. Finally, you will learn about Image features.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the basics of image classification.
- Compare and contrast the differences between different supervised Image classification methods.
- Create your image classifier using Supervised learning techniques in CV Studio.
