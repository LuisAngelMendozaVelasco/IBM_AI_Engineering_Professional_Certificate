# Image Processing with OpenCV and Pillow

Image processing enhances images or extracts useful information from the image. In this module, we will learn the basics of image processing with Python libraries OpenCV and Pillow.

## Learning Objectives

- Review the fundamental concepts of digital image processing.
- Explain the basics of image processing techniques.
- Apply image processing and analysis techniques to computer vision problem.
