# Clustering

In this module, you will learn about clustering specifically k-means clustering. You learn how the k-means clustering algorithm works and how to use k-means clustering for customer segmentation.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the K-Means Clustering technique.
- Describe accuracy concerns for the K-Means Clustering technique.
