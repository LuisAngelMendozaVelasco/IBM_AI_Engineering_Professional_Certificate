# Module 4

In this Module, in the PyTorch part, you will complete a peer review assessment where you will be asked to build an image classifier using the ResNet18 pre-trained model. In the Keras part, for the peer review assessment, you will be asked to build an image classifier using the VGG16 pre-trained model and compare its performance with the model that we built in the previous Module using the ResNet50 pre-trained model.

## Learning Objectives

- Build an image classifier using the ResNet18 pretrained models using PyTorch.
- Use the VGG16 pre-trained deep learning models to build an image classifier, evaluate it, and report performance in Keras.
- Use the image classifier built in the previous module to compare performance with model built in this module.
- Complete a peer review assignment
