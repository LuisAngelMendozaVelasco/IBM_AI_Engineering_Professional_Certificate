# Module 1 - Loading Data

In this module, you will get introduced to the problem that we will try to solve throughout the course. You will also learn how to load the image dataset, manipulate images, and visualize them.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the problem and get acquainted with the data that will be used to build an image classifier.
- Load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize the image dataset.
