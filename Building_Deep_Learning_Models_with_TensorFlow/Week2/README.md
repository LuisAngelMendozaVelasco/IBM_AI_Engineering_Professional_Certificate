# Supervised Learning Models

In this module, you will learn about about Convolutional Neural Networks, and the building blocks of a convolutional neural network, such as convolution and feature learning. You will also learn about the popular MNIST database. Finally, you will learn how to build a Multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural networks in Python and using TensorFlow.

## Learning Objectives

- Define Convolutional Neural Networks and how CNN structure can extract an element from an image.
- Explain what a ReLu activation function is.
- Describe the 3 layers of digit recognition.
- Define the Pre-processing, Training, and Inference phases of the deep learning process.
- Recognize the MNIST Database and explain its uses.
- Describe what a neuron is and its utilization in CNNs.
- Define the hidden layers of CNN such as the convolutional layer, pooling layer, and the fully connected layer.
- Apply filters and kernels to an image.
- Recognize how to identify the proper kernel to use on an image.
- Define what a node is.
- Summarize what Softmax is and its utilizations in the CNN architecture.
- Compose two Neural Networks capable of performing handwritten digits classification.
