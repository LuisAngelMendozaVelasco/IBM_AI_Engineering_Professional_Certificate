# Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow

## What you'll learn

- Explain foundational TensorFlow concepts such as the main functions, operations and the execution pipelines. 
- Describe how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions.
- Analyze different types of Deep Architectures, such as Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks and Autoencoders.
- Apply TensorFlow for backpropagation to tune the weights and biases while the Neural Networks are being trained.
