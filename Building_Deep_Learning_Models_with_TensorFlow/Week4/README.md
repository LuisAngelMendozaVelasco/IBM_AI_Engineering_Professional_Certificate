# Unsupervised Deep Learning Models

In this module, you will learn about the applications of unsupervised learning. You will learn about Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), and how to train an RBM. Finally, you will apply Restricted Boltzmann Machines to build a recommendation system.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the applications of Unsupervised Learning.
- Define what a Restricted Boltzmann Machine is and its uses.
- Train a Restricted Boltzmann Machine.
- Apply Restricted Boltzmann Machines to build a recommendation system
