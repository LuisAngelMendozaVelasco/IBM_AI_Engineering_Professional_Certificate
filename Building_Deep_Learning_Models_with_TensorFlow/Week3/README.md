# Supervised Learning Models (Cont'd)

In this module, you will learn about the recurrent neural network model, and special type of a recurrent neural network, which is the Long Short-Term Memory model. Also, you will learn about the Recursive Neural Tensor Network theory, and finally, you will apply recurrent neural networks to language modelling.
