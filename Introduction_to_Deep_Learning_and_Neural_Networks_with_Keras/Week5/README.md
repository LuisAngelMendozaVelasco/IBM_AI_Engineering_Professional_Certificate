# Course Project

In this module, you will conclude the course by working on a final assignment where you will use the Keras library to build a regression model and experiment with the depth and the width of the model.

## Learning Objectives

- Build a regression model using the Keras library.
- Describe the impact on the performance through increasing the number of training epochs and changing the number of hidden layers.

## Build a Deep Learning Model
