# Keras and Deep Learning Libraries

In this module, you will learn about the diifferent deep learning libraries namely, Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. You will also learn how to build regression and classification models using the Keras library.

## Learning Objectives

- Compare and contrast the different deep learning libraries namely, Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.
- Build a regression model using the Keras library.
- Build a classifiicatioin model using the Keras library.
