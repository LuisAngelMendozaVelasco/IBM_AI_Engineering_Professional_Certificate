# Deep Learning Models

In this module, you will learn about the difference between the shallow and deep neural networks. You will also learn about convolutional networks and how to build them using the Keras library. Finally, you will also learn about recurrent neural networks and autoencoders.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the difference between the shallow and deep neural networks.
- Describe Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- Build CNNs using the Keras library.
- Define Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
- Describe autoencoders and their functions.
