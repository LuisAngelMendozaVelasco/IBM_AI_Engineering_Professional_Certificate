# Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning

In this module, you will learn about exciting applications of deep learning and why now is the perfect time to learn deep learning. You will also learn about neural networks and how most of the deep learning algorithms are inspired by the way our brain functions and the neurons process data. Finally, you will learn about how neural networks feed data forward through the network.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the applications of deep learning and explain why it is really rewarding to learn deep learning.
- Explain neural networks and how most of the deep learning algorithms are inspired by the way the brain functions and neurons process data.
- Summarize how neural networks feed data forward through the network.
- Build a neural network and see how it performs predictions using fast forward propagation.
